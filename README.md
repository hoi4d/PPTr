Official PyTorch code for PPTR, a 4D backbone for long-term point cloud video understanding. 
we leverage the primitive plane as a mid-level representation to capture the long-term spatial-temporal context in 4D point cloud videos, and propose a novel hierarchical backbone named Point Primitive Transformer(PPTr), which is mainly composed of intra-primitive point transformers and primitive transformers.
